To design a local office in a dusty, rainy quarry, prioritize durability and functionality. Utilize corrugated iron sheets for the roof to withstand rain, with half brick walls and half transparent iron sheets for visibility. Employ sturdy barriers for safety against truck accidents and reflective tape for visibility. Install sliding windows for efficient paper transactions, and comfortable, easy-to-clean furniture. Provide a front shade for sun and rain protection. Ensure good ventilation, strong locks, and a notice board for communication. This design balances practicality and resilience in challenging conditions, catering to the needs of the clerk and drivers.
